Hi, fortunately I managed to get my project in on time

The code requires pip installing the following packages: numpy, pillow,
pathlib, and matplotlib

If you would like to test some things without spending too much time to
understand the code, you can try test.py - it has one function that lets
you see the simulation run tick by tick, and another that lets you perform a
trial of the disembarking method, compliance level, average # of carry-ons,
and sample size of your choosing, and then saves it into a json file

example uses and descriptions for the test.py functions are found in test.py
