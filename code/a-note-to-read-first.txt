Hi, fortunately I managed to get my project in on time

If you would like to test some things without spending too much time to
understand the code, you can try test.py - it has one function that lets
you see the simulation run tick by tick, and another that lets you perform a
trial of the disembarking method, compliance level, and average # of carry-ons
of your choosing, and then saves it into a json file

more information about them, and how to use them, is found is test.py
